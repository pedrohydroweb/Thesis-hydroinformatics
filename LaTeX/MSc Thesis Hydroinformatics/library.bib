abstract = {Combined Sewer Overflow (CSO) infrastructure are conventionally designed based on historical climate data. Yet, variability in rainfall intensities and patterns caused by climate change have a significant impact on the performance of an urban drainage system. Although rainwater harvesting (RWH) is a potential solution to manage stormwater in urban areas, its benefits in mitigating the climate change impacts on combined sewer networks have not been assessed yet. Hence, the goal of the present study was set to evaluate the effectiveness of RWH in alleviating the potential impacts of climate change on CSOs. To do so, first, future rainfall was achieved through the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5) based on modified historical record. Then, rainfall-runoff modeling was employed using the U.S. EPA Stormwater management model (SWMM) to study the response of CSO outfalls to future rainfall. The study site was the combined sewer network of the City of Toledo, Ohio. Results showed that under the maximum impact scenario in the near future, climate change might cause up to approximately 12–18{\%} increase in CSOs occurrence, volume and duration in Toledo. However, an RWH plan with the capacity of 0.76 m3(200 gal) implemented on half on the buildings throughout the area, appeared to be able to mitigate the potential future impacts, and showed a remarkable controlling performance in the peak flow periods. This plan also met toilet flushing demands. Therefore, RWH can be considered as a feasible solution to mitigate future climate change impacts on CSOs and supply water demands.},

abstract = {Abstract: The Horton equation, which is widely used to predict infiltration of water into soil, is inapplicable when the rainfall intensity is less than the initial infiltration capacity of the soil, especially during the early stages of a storm event. This study modifies the Horton equation to satisfy this condition by considering the rainfall intensity as an independent variable in addition to the other physical parameters used in the original model. The modification is based on dividing the entire infiltration relation into two curves intersecting each other at the ponding time. The two curves are then matched asymptotically into a composite relation that does not require implementing the ponding time parameter explicitly. The proposed relation satisfies the infiltration capacity of the soil such that, when ponding occurs, the difference between the potential and cumulative infiltration becomes zero. This agreement suggests that the proposed relation would be valid for describing the infiltration process within a wide range of rainfall intensities greater or less than the infiltration capacity. The proposed relation will be useful to extend our ability for understanding hydrologic processes related to rainfall infiltration in arid and semiarid environments.},

abstract = {The usefulness of a hydrologic model is directly related to its application and how well it is calibrated. Calibration is a subjective exercise where model parameters are adjusted to reduce discrepancies between measured data and modeled predictions. Automated calibration can be used to accelerate the model calibration process, minimize modeler bias, and increase the goodness of fit between measured and modeled hydro graphs. During calibration of a complex hydrologic model, it may be difficult to simultaneously adjust predicted output hydrographs to correspondingly match multiple objectives (peak flows, total volume and shape of the hydrograph). Custom programming was used to link SWMM Runoff version 4.4h with Palisade's Evolver software to improve model goodness of fit. A small sanitary sewer basin was simulated as part of a collection system rehabilitation pilot program to judge the effectiveness of infiltration and inflow (III) removal. A one-month time series of hourly flow measurements were used and calibration was perfonned with an automated calibration method that applied a genetic algorithm solution technique. Several goodness-of-fit metrics revealed an improved calibration for both pre-and post-rehabilitation flow hydrograph, as well as for projected hydrographs to a design event. This study demonstrates an accurate and cost-effective automated method for model calibration that is not only valuable for repeated model analyses perfonned throughout a collection system rehabilitation program, but can also be applied to other watershed models.},

@article{Mosley2001,
abstract = {Rainfall dependent inflow and infiltration (RDII) is a significant, though undesirable, component of the urban wet-weather water budget in many sanitary sewer systems. Costs and environmental damage attributable to RDII are significant. Costs may be accrued through increased treatment and conveyance costs, increased maintenance costs, and sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). To reduce these costs and mitigate environmental damage, engineered solutions require estimations of the long-term characteristics of the RDII response to wet weather. This in turn requires estimation of the performance of the existing collection and treatment system, as well as the expected performance of various possible solutions. Due to the complex number of available pathways that RDII may enter a sanitary sewer, RDII is one of the most difficult components of the urban wet- weather water budget to estimate. RDII observations typically indicate response times that may range from several minutes to several days or weeks. This is confounded by regional and/or seasonal groundwater trends that influence RDII response. Various tools have been applied to estimating this special hydrologic response, including the rational method and several unit- hydrograph methods. This chapter provides an overview of available RDII estimation methods and highlights results from a relatively new physically based conceptual method first introduced by Kadota and Djebbar (1998). Kadota and Djebbar (1998) reported on modifications to the USEPA SWMM RUNOFF model that include the response of a conceptual non-linear reservoir to changes in groundwater elevations resulting from permeable-area infiltration. The model has recently been applied to a sanitary collection system in Vallejo California. Initial results indicate the modified RUNOFF model is very good at computing RDII, including the delayed, seasonally varying groundwater components of RDII. It is recommended that the USEPA SWMM model be updated with the revisions made by Kadota and Djebbar (1998).},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 by the authors. The new generation of weather observatory satellites, namely Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) constellation satellites, is the lead observatory of the 10 highly advanced earth orbiting weather research satellites. Indeed, GPM is the first satellite that has been designed to measure light rain and snowfall, in addition to heavy tropical rainfall. This work compares the final run of the Integrated Multi-satellitE Retrievals for GPM (IMERG) product, the post real time of TRMM and Multi-satellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA-3B42) and the Era-Interim product from the European Centre for Medium RangeWeather Forecasts (ECMWF) against the Iran Meteorological Organization (IMO) daily precipitation measured by the synoptic rain-gauges over four regions with different topography and climate conditions in Iran. Assessment is implemented for a one-year period from March 2014 to February 2015. Overall, in daily scale the results reveal that all three products lead to underestimation but IMERG performs better than other products and underestimates precipitation slightly in all four regions. Based on monthly and seasonal scale, in Guilan all products, in Bushehr and Kermanshah ERA-Interim and in Tehran IMERG and ERA-Interim tend to underestimate. The correlation coefficient between IMERG and the rain-gauge data in daily scale is far superior to that of Era-Interim and TMPA-3B42. On the basis of daily timescale of bias in comparison with the ground data, the IMERG product far outperforms ERA-Interim and 3B42 products. According to the categorical verification technique in this study, IMERG yields better results for detection of precipitation events on the basis of Probability of Detection (POD), Critical Success Index (CSI) and False Alarm Ratio (FAR) in those areas with stratiform and orographic precipitation, such as Tehran and Kermanshah, compared with other satellite/model data sets. In particular, for heavy precipitation ( {\textgreater} 15 mm/day), IMERG is superior to the other products in all study areas and could be used in future for meteorological and hydrological models, etc.},

abstract = {Precipitation is one of the essential variables in rainfall-runoff modeling. For hydrological purposes, the most commonly used data sources of precipitation are rain gauges and weather radars. Recently, multi-satellite precipitation estimates have gained importance thanks to the emergence of Integrated Multisatellite Retrievals for Global Precipitation Measurement (IMERG GPM), a successor of a very successful Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) mission which has been providing high-quality precipitation estimates for almost two decades. Hydrological modeling of mountainous catchment requires reliable precipitation inputs in both time and space as the hydrological response of such a catchment is very quick. This paper presents an inter-comparison of event-based rainfall-runoff simulations using precipitation data originating from three different sources. For semi-distributed modeling of discharge in the mountainous river, the Hydrologic Engineering Center-Hydrologic Modelling System (HEC-HMS) is applied. The model was calibrated and validated for the period 2014–2016 using measurement data from the Upper Skawa catchment a small mountainous catchment in southern Poland. The performance of the model was assessed using the Nash–Sutcliffe efficiency coefficient (NSE), Pearson's correlation coefficient (r), Percent bias (PBias) and Relative peak flow difference (rPFD). The results show that for the event-based modeling adjusted radar rainfall estimates and IMERG GPM satellite precipitation estimates are the most reliable precipitation data sources. For each source of the precipitation data the model was calibrated separately as the spatial and temporal distributions of rainfall significantly impact the estimated values of model parameters. It has been found that the applied Soil Conservation Service (SCS) Curve Number loss method performs best for flood events having a unimodal time distribution. The analysis of the simulation time-steps indicates that time aggregation of precipitation data from 1 to 2 h (not exceeding the response time of the catchment) provide a significant improvement of flow simulation results for all the models while further aggregation, up to 4 h, seems to be valuable only for model based on rain gauge precipitation data.},

abstract = {Water resources numerical models are dependent upon various input hydrologic field data. As models become increasingly complex and model simulation times expand, it is critical to understand the inherent value in using different input datasets available. One important category of model input is precipitation data. For hydrologic models, the precipitation data inputs are perhaps the most critical. Common precipitation model input includes either rain gauge or remotely-sensed data such next-generation radar-based (NEXRAD) data. NEXRAD data provides a higher level of spatial resolution than point rain gauge coverage, but is subject to more extensive data pre and post processing along with additional computational requirements. This study first documents the development and initial calibration of a HEC-HMS model of a subtropical watershed in the Upper St. Johns River Basin in Florida, USA. Then, the study compares calibration performance of the same HEC-HMS model using either rain gauge or NEXRAD precipitation inputs. The results are further discretized by comparing key calibration statistics such as Nash–Sutcliffe Efficiency for different spatial scale and at different rainfall return frequencies. The study revealed that at larger spatial scale, the calibration performance of the model was about the same for the two different precipitation datasets while the study showed some benefit of NEXRAD for smaller watersheds. Similarly, the study showed that for smaller return frequency precipitation events, NEXRAD data was superior.},

@article{Muleta2008,
abstract = {Excessive wet weather flow resulting from rainfall-derived inflow and infiltration (RDII) is a major source of sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). SSOs pose serious problem to the public and the environment by causing back up into basements and sewer overflows to streets and rivers. Control of sewer overflows is, therefore, vital to reducing risks to public health and protecting the environment from water pollution. Computer modeling of sewer collection systems plays an important role in determining sound and economical remedial solutions that reduce RDII, improve system integrity, reliability and performance, and avoid overflows. This paper presents a rigorous and efficient three-step optimization methodology for use in solving the sewer overflow problem. The first step analyzes measured sewer flow and rainfall data and decomposes the flow data into dry-weather flow and wet-weather flow components. The second step computes the optimal RTK parameters of the tri-triangular unit hydrograph that is commonly used to model RDII into the sewer collection system. The optimal RTK parameters are calibrated with genetic algorithm so that the simulated RDII flows closely match the RDII time series generated by decomposing the measured flow data. In the final step, the calibrated model is then used with genetic algorithm to design cost-effective solutions for existing SSO problems. Design parameters can include any combinations of pipe size, storage, slope, and pumping. The proposed wet-weather flow decomposition, optimal calibration, and optimal design models are demonstrated using an example sewer collection system. The methodology seems a good alternative to other methods proposed in the literature and should prove useful for engineers and planners that are involved in mitigating complex SSO problems. {\textcopyright} 2008 ASCE.},

abstract = {Chemical dosing is a commonly used strategy for mitigating sewer corrosion and odour problems caused by sulfide production. Prediction of sewage flow variation in real-time is critical for the optimization of chemical dosing to achieve cost-effective mitigation of hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S). Autoregressive (AR) models have previously been used for real-time sewage prediction. However, the prediction showed significant delays in wet weather conditions. In this paper, autoregressive with exogenous inputs (ARX) models are employed to reduce the delays with rainfall data used as model inputs. The model is applied to predicting sewage flows at two real-life sewage pumping stations (SPSs) with different hydraulic characteristics and climatic conditions. The calibrated models were capable of predicting flow rates in both cases, much more accurately than previously developed AR models under wet weather conditions. Simulation of on-line chemical dosing control based on the predicted flows showed excellent sulfide mitigation performance at reduced cost.},

abstract = {Few investigations have been made into modelling snowmelt in urban areas; hence, current urban snowmelt routines have adopted parameters and approaches intended for rural areas that are not appropriate in an urban environment. This paper examines problems with current urban snowmelt models and proposes a model that uses parameters developed from field studies focusing exclusively on urban snow. The Urban Snow Model (USM) uses an energy balance scheme at an hourly time step, changes in urban snow albedo, and incorporates eight different types of redistributed snow cover. USM is tested against observed flow data from a small residential community located in Calgary, Alberta. The degree-day method for snowmelt, the SWMM model, and a modified version of USM that incorporates a partial energy budget scheme relying only on net radiation, are also tested against the observed flow data. The full energy budget version of USM outperformed all other models in terms of time to peak, peak flowrate and model efficiency; however, the modified version of USM fared quite well and is recommended when a lack of data exists. The degree-day method and the SWMM models fared poorly and were unable to simulate peak flowrates in most cases. The tests also demonstrated the need to distribute snow into appropriate snow covers in order to simulate peak flowrates accurately and provide good model efficiency.},

abstract = {Rainfall-runoff models play an important role in urban water resource management. The storm water management model (SWMM) developed by the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a widely used dynamic rainfall-runoff model for analyzing quantity and quality problems associated with urban drainage systems. In an ideal situation, the SWMM model would be designed and analyzed using a collection of catchment modeling systems. Traditionally, catchment discretization for rainfall-runoff modeling is performed manually on watershed maps, a time-consuming job with less-than-accurate results. An alternative approach to catchment discretization based on geographic information system (GIS) is proposed in this paper. The automatic discretization approach was successfully applied to rainfall-runoff modeling in Macau using a SWMM model. The results showed that the proposed approach outperformed the conventional catchment-discretization method in terms of producing meaningful parameters and avoiding most of the tedious preliminary tasks.},

abstract = {Abstract. For the analysis of climate impact on flood flows and flood frequency in macroscale river basins, hydrological models can be forced by several sets of hourly long-term climate time series. Considering the large number of model units, the small time step and the required recalibrations for different model forcing an efficient calibration strategy and optimisation algorithm are essential. This study investigates the impact of different calibration strategies and different optimisation algorithms on the performance and robustness of a semi-distributed model. The different calibration strategies were (a) Lumped, (b) 1-Factor, (c) Distributed and (d) Regionalisation. The latter uses catchment characteristics and estimates parameter values via transfer functions. These methods were applied in combination with three different optimisation algorithms: PEST, DDS, and SCE. In addition to the standard temporal evaluation of the calibration strategies, a spatial evaluation was applied. This was done by transferring the parameters from calibrated catchments to uncalibrated ones and validating the model performance of these uncalibrated catchments. The study was carried out for five sub-catchments of the Aller-Leine River Basin in Northern Germany. The best result for temporal evaluation was achieved by using the combination of the DDS optimisation with the Distributed strategy. The Regionalisation method obtained the weakest performance for temporal evaluation. However, for spatial evaluation the Regionalisation indicated more robust models, closely followed by the Lumped method. The 1-Factor and the Distributed strategy showed clear disadvantages regarding spatial parameter transferability. For the parameter estimation based on catchment descriptors as required for ungauged basins, the Regionalisation strategy seems to be a promising tool particularly in climate impact analysis and for hydrological modelling in general.},

Optimization algorithm performance was compared for each of the available basin-model combinations. For each model-basin pair, 40 calibrations were run with the 10 algorithms. Results were tested for statistical significance using a multicomparison procedure based on Friedman and Kruskal-Wallis tests. A dispersion metric was used to evaluate the fitness landscape underlying the structure on each test case. The trials revealed that the dimensionality and general fitness landscape characteristics of the model calibration problem are important when considering the use of an automatic optimization method. The ASA, CMAES, and DDS algorithms were either as good as or better than the other methods for finding the lowest minimum, with ASA being consistently among the best. The SCE–UA method performs better when the model complexity is reduced, whereas the opposite is true for DDS. Convergence speed was also studied, and the same three methods (CMAES, DDS, and ASA) were shown to converge faster than the other methods. The SCE–UA method converged nearly as fast as the best methods when the model with the smallest parameter space was used but was not as worthy in the higher-dimension parameter space of the other models. Convergence speed has little impact on algorithm efficiency. The methods offering the worst performance were DE, CS, GA, HS, and PSO, although they did manage to find good local minima in some trials. However, the other available methods generally outperformed these algorithms.},

abstract = {A new global optimization algorithm, dynamically dimensioned search (DDS), is introduced for automatic calibration of watershed simulation models. DDS is designed for calibration problems with many parameters, requires no algorithm parameter tuning, and automatically scales the search to find good solutions within the maximum number of user-specified function (or model) evaluations. As a result, DDS is ideally suited for computationally expensive optimization problems such as distributed watershed model calibration. DDS performance is compared to the shuffled complex evolution (SCE) algorithm for multiple optimization test functions as well as real and synthetic SWAT2000 model automatic calibration formulations. Algorithms are compared for optimization problems ranging from 6 to 30 dimensions, and each problem is solved in 1000 to 10,000 total function evaluations per optimization trial. Results are presented so that future modelers can assess algorithm performance at a computational scale relevant to their modeling case study. In all four of the computationally expensive real SWAT2000 calibration formulations considered here (14, 14, 26, and 30 calibration parameters), results show DDS to be more efficient and effective than SCE. In two cases, DDS requires only 15–20{\%} of the number of model evaluations used by SCE in order to find equally good values of the objective function. Overall, the results also show that DDS rapidly converges to good calibration solutions and easily avoids poor local optima. The simplicity of the DDS algorithm allows for easy recoding and subsequent adoption into any watershed modeling application framework.},

@article{Vallabhaneni2007,
abstract = {A properly designed, operated and maintained sanitary sewer system is meant to collect and convey all of the sewage that flows into it to a wastewater treatment plant. However, occasional unintentional discharges of raw sewage from municipal sanitary sewers – called sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs) – occur in many systems. Rainfall-derived infiltration and inflow (RDII) into sanitary sewer systems has long been recognized as a major source of operating problems, causing poor performance of many sewer systems. RDII is the main cause of SSOs to customer basements, streets, or nearby streams and can also cause serious operating problems at wastewater treatment facilities. There is a need to develop proven methodologies and computer tools to assist communities in developing SSO control plans that are in line with their projected annual capital budgets and provide flexibility in future improvements. To accomplish this goal, EPA entered into a cooperative research and development agreement (CRADA) with Camp Dresser {\&} McKee, Inc. (CDM) to develop public-domain software tools to support SSO control planning. These tools, named the Sanitary Sewer Overflow Analysis and Planning (SSOAP) Toolbox, are accompanied by this technical document that describes how to use the Toolbox in analyzing infiltration/inflow, performing capacity analyses of sanitary sewer systems, and developing SSO control plans. It is the intent of this report to provide the Toolbox users with technical information needed for its effective use for analysis and mitigation of SSO-related problems. The technical report is not intended to serve as the user manual for the SSOAP Toolbox, which is a separate document included with the software package. Instead, it provides an introductory hydrologic approach and identifies a RDII methodology for initial incorporation into the SSOAP Toolbox; an overview of the required sewer system hydraulic analysis; and data collection requirements to support SSO planning and analysis using the SSOAP Toolbox. In addition, the report describes the tools and their functions for performing a sanitary sewer system capacity assessment. The report also includes a description of the application of EPA's Storm Water Management Model Version 5 (SWMM5) application within the SSOAP Toolbox for assessing the baseline hydraulic conditions of the system and quantifying capacity improvements of various identified improvement scenarios. Guidance is provided for establishing system improvement objectives, screening potential options for improvements, developing improvement scenarios, and using SWMM5 model output to evaluate alternatives. Finally, the report provides a case study that demonstrates how the RDII methodology described in this technical report has been effectively used in SSO planning and analysis.},

MATERIAL AND METHODS: Eighteen rats divided into two groups-demyelinating lesion (group I, N = 12) and vehicle group (saline injected; group II, N = 6)-were studied. A 0.2-microl quantity of 1{\%} LPC solution in isotonic saline was injected in the rat brain internal capsule (IC) area to create the demyelinating lesion. Six rats were used exclusively for histology. Diffusion-weighted (DW) images were acquired at different diffusion weightings on the 3rd, 5th, 10th, 15th, and 20th days after LPC injection. ADC was measured from three regions of interest (ROIs) within the IC: focal demyelinating lesion (area A), surrounding area of the lesion (area B), and contralateral IC area (area C). RESULTS: Histology revealed demyelination of the IC area during the early phase of lesion progression up to day 10 and remyelination thereafter. Elevated ADCs were observed for the surrounding edematous area (area B), compared to the focal demyelinating lesion (area A) during the early phase of the demyelination process, while substantial reduction of ADCs was noticed during remyelination for both regions. CONCLUSION: Measurement of ADC showed clear differentiation of the surrounding edema from the LPC-induced focal demyelinating lesion in rats, especially during the early phase of the lesion progression},

abstract = {Snow accumulation and snowmelt studies have been carried out for almost a century in Finland. At present the results of these studies are widely used e.g. in flood forecasting and in forestry, agriculture, transportation and building research.This paper first discusses the problems of snow measure ments. The effects of climatic and terrain conditions on the mieto-, meso and macrovariability of snow cover are thereafter analyzed. Snowmelt is dealt with both statistically and physically. A snowmelt rnodel suitable for operational use in Finnish river basins is outlined. The characteristics and formation of spring runoff in both small and large basins are studied. Finally, winter- and springtime evaporation and snow cover in special en vironments — lakes and urban areas — are considered.},
